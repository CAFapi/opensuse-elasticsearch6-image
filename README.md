# openSUSE and Elasticsearch 6 image

This project builds on the openSUSE Java 8 image [here](https://github.com/CAFapi/opensuse-java8-images) to build a pre-configured Elasticsearch 6 Docker image.

It can be used as a base image for any projects which use Elasticsearch.

### Docker host setup
[The `vm.max_map_count` kernel setting needs to be set on host to at least `262144` for production use](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/docker.html#docker-cli-run-prod-mode):

`sysctl -w vm.max_map_count=262144`

### Tini
[Tini](https://github.com/krallin/tini) is pre-installed in the container.  If the image entrypoint is not overwritten then it will be automatically used.

### PostgreSQL Client
[PostgreSQL Client](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/app-psql.html) is pre-installed in the container. psql is a terminal-based front-end to PostgreSQL. It enables you to type in queries interactively, issue them to PostgreSQL, and see the query results. Alternatively, input can be from a file or from command line arguments. In addition, psql provides a number of meta-commands and various shell-like features to facilitate writing scripts and automating a wide variety of tasks.

### Startup Scripts
Any executable scripts added to the `/startup/startup.d/` directory will be automatically run each time the container is started (assuming the image entrypoint is not overwritten).

### Pre-Installed Startup Scripts

#### Certificate Installation
The image comes pre-installed with a startup script which provides a mechanism to extend the CA certificates which should be trusted.

### Pre-Installed Utility Scripts

#### Database Creation Script
The image comes pre-installed with a utility script which can be used to check if a PostgreSQL database exists and to create it if it does not.

When the script is called it must be passed an environment variable prefix for the service:

    /scripts/check-create-pgdb.sh SERVICE_

The script then reads the database details from a set of environment variables with the specified prefix:

| **Environment Variable**    |                                          **Description**                                               |
|-----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `SERVICE_`DATABASE_HOST     | The host name of the machine on which the PostgreSQL server is running.                                |
| `SERVICE_`DATABASE_PORT     | The TCP port on which the PostgreSQL server is listening for connections.                              |
| `SERVICE_`DATABASE_USERNAME | The username to use when establishing the connection to the PostgreSQL server.                         |
| `SERVICE_`DATABASE_PASSWORD | The password to use when establishing the connection to the PostgreSQL server.                         |
| `SERVICE_`DATABASE_APPNAME  | The application name that PostgreSQL should associate with the connection for logging and monitoring.  |
| `SERVICE_`DATABASE_NAME     | The name of the PostgreSQL database to be created.                                                     |
